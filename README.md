## 1. Mission

Create a simple REST application from scratch. Using NestJS (TypeScript), MongoDB, RabbitMQ.
The application should implement a nodeJS server API communicating with ReqresAPI: https://reqres.in/

The application should consist of:

- `POST` /api/users

  On the request store the user entry in db. After the creation, send an email and rabbit event. Both can be dummy sending (no consumer needed).

- `GET` /api/user/{userId}

  Retrieves data from https://reqres.in/api/users/{userId} and returns a user in JSON representation.

- `GET` /api/user/{userId}/avatar

  Retrieves image by 'avatar' URL.

  On the first request it should save the image as a plain file, stored as a mongodb entry with userId and hash. Return its base64-encoded representation.

On following requests should return the previously saved file in base64-encoded. representation (retrieve from db).
- `DELETE` /api/user/{userId}/avatar

  Removes the file from the FileSystem storage.

  Removes the stored entry from db.
